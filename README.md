Where Did My Money Go -  A bot for figuring out where all my money went 

Every month, I look over my finances and compile a summary of how much I have--or don't have anymore. And it puzzles me. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?? In my efforts to uncover this mystery, I have been manually copying over each transaction from my financial statement and tagging them in excel. This takes 2-3 hours, and is honestly quite fun to do. But I feel like making a bot to do it for me might be more fun. So here goes nothing! 

My first python project ^_^
